# Hand-Abstracted Data

This directory contains CSVs of hand-abstracted data (e.g. from PDFs). They're
included here as one-off abstraction tasks.

- `cru-cryptics-pdf.csv`: clues from the three PDFs (`Cryptic217.pdf`,
  `Cryptic225.pdf` and `Cryptic235.pdf`) from the `cru_cryptics` archive,
  initially provided by [Michael F. Gill](https://bbtp.net/) and subsequently
  augmented by [George Ho](https://www.eigenfoo.xyz/).

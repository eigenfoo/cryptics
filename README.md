# Cryptic Crossword Clues

> A Python library to scrape three cryptic crossword blogs and parse the scraped
> blog posts into a structured dataset of cryptic crossword clues. The three
> blogs are [http://bigdave44.com/](http://bigdave44.com/),
> [https://www.fifteensquared.net/](https://www.fifteensquared.net/) and
> [https://times-xwd-times.livejournal.com/](https://times-xwd-times.livejournal.com/).

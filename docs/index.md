`cryptics.georgeho.org` is a dataset of cryptic crossword[^1] clues, indicators and charades, collected from various blogs and digital archives.

[^1]: If you're new to cryptic crosswords, rejoice! A whole new world awaits you! _The New Yorker_ has [an excellent introduction to cryptic crosswords](https://www.newyorker.com/puzzles-and-games-dept/cryptic-crossword/reintroducing-the-new-yorkers-cryptic-crossword), and Matt Gritzmacher has [a daily newsletter with links to crosswords](https://crosswordlinks.substack.com/).

This dataset is a significant work of crossword archivism and scholarship,
as acquiring historical crosswords and structuring their contents require
focused effort and tedious cleaning that few are willing to do for such trivial data -
for example, according to [this selection guide](/static/documents/Selection_AppendixE_v2.pdf)[^2],
the Library of Congress explicitly does not collect crossword puzzles.

[^2]: Heard through [Saul Pwanson](https://www.saul.pw/), sourced from the [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20170222163604/https://www.loc.gov/library/reports/co_bpr/JIG-S/Selection_AppendixE_v2.pdf).

This project indexes various blogs and digital archives for cryptic crosswords.
Several fields - such as
clues, answers, clue numbers, annotations or commentary, puzzle title and publication date -
are parsed and extracted into a tabular dataset.
The result is **over half a million clues from cryptic crosswords over the past twelve years**.

Two other datasets are subsequently derived from the clues - wordplay indicators and charades (a.k.a. substitutions).
All told, the derived datasets contain **over ten thousand wordplay indicators** and **over sixty thousand charades**.

Currently the sources for clues are:

Detailed documentation can be found on [the datasheet](/datasheet)
and the source code for creating the dataset is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/eigenfoo/cryptics).

[^4]: The CSV request will only return the first 1000 rows, [click here](/data/clues.csv?_stream=on&_size=max) to stream all rows (this will take a while). The JSON request is paginated with 100 rows per page.

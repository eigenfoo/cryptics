`cryptics.eigenfoo.xyz` is a dataset of cryptic crossword[^1] clues, indicators
and charades, collected from various blogs and publicly available digital
archives.

[^1]: If you're new to cryptic crosswords, rejoice! A whole new world awaits you! _The New Yorker_ has [an excellent introduction to cryptic crosswords](https://www.newyorker.com/puzzles-and-games-dept/cryptic-crossword/reintroducing-the-new-yorkers-cryptic-crossword), and Matt Gritzmacher has [a daily newsletter with links to crosswords](https://crosswordlinks.substack.com/).

The project scrapes several blogs and digital archives for cryptic crosswords.
Out of these collected web pages, the clues, answers, clue numbers, blogger's
explanation and commentary, puzzle title and publication date are all parsed
and extracted into a tabular dataset. The result (as of September 2021) is
**over half a million clues from cryptic crosswords over the past twelve
years**.

Two other datasets are subsequently derived from the clues - wordplay
indicators and charades (a.k.a.  substitutions). All told, the derived datasets
contain **over ten thousand wordplay indicators** and **over sixty thousand
charades**.

Currently the sources for clues are:
